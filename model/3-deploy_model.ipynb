To achieve this, the model intricately integrates and analyzes a diverse range of data, encompassing clinical metrics, such as psychological assessments, and behavioral indicators, including platform engagement and login frequency.\n",

By identifying patients who are potentially at risk of a negative outcome early in their treatment journey, the model empowers healthcare providers and the HelloBetter platform to allocate resources and attention more effectively, thereby enhancing the overall efficacy of the therapeutic interventions.\n",
